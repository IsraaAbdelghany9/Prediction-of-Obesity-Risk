## Project Overview
Obesity is a growing global health concern. This project uses machine learning to predict obesity risk based on various features such as dietary habits, physical activity, and demographic information. The goal is to provide a tool that can help in early identification and intervention.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information on:
- Demographics (age, gender, etc.)
- Dietary habits
- Physical activity levels
- Health-related metrics

Ensure you have the dataset in the appropriate format before running the project.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- LightGBM (LGBM) for model training
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for preprocessing and evaluation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/prediction-of-obesity-risk.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Prediction-of-Obesity-Risk
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook prediction-of-obesity-risk-iti-project.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.


## Model Details
The project uses the LightGBM (LGBM) model for prediction. LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that is efficient and scalable for large datasets. The model is trained on preprocessed data and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
